# Ed's Garage Sale: The 3.0 version of my original React site for my family to sell antiques.

My family sold a few hundred dollars worth of antiques from my grandfather Ed with help from this site. With garage sale and auction season approaching, it is time for it to be spruced up. But first, a history.

This project was forked from my follow along progress of a paid course. Stephen Grider in the course [Node with React: Fullstack Web Development](https://www.udemy.com/course/node-with-react-fullstack-web-development/) ([with complementary repo](https://github.com/StephenGrider/FullstackReactCode)) is where I forked this from. However, I didn't know he publicized the code for the course, which is why this project was in a private repo for the longest time. That version is what I call version 1, and I forked it from there. I have gone mostly my way with this, particularly in the frontend, so between my own spin and the fact that his code is open source I am publishing this repo going forward. Then I moved onto a [Gatsby implementation](https://github.com/michael-small/ARCHIVE_Eds-Garage-Sale), what I call the 2.0. However, I like this repo more because it saw real use and because I have my own learning I want to get done with Gatsby before I make a stable project with it. So now that it has a public fork, this is what I call version 3.0. It is in the process of being fixed up with a year of new React skills since I started it. It will likely recircle around to Gatsby, or maybe Next.js, for the sake of my family loading it easily.

To start project:
* Set env vars for mongo/google auth
* `npm run dev`
